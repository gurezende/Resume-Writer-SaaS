Summary:

This Senior Data Scientist will help scale our Call Center AI (CCAI) initiatives within the client Customer organization. Their primary responsibilities are to develop Generative AI (GenAI) systems that support the CCAI initiatives & then to productionalize these within client's technical ecosystem This role will join a growing team of data scientists and machine learning engineers to solve key business needs. They will collaborate with data scientists, SMEs and communicate results to non-technical audiences.

Responsibilities:

Lead efforts prototyping and deploying production-grade GenAI models at scale.
Promote and role-model AIOps best practices (prompt engineering, evaluation, versioning).
Design and create workflows for building and deploying AI agents and tool-using models.
Build scalable pipelines for embedding generation, vector storage, prompt templates, etc.
Design rigorous evaluation frameworks for LLMs, agents, and prompt chains across domains.
Collaborate and maintain codebases using standard version control and GIT principles.
Partner with data engineers and analysts to align data architecture with GenAI needs.
Write well-structured code that implements software engineering best practices.
Work closely with stakeholders to translate business problems into GenAI products.

Required Skills:

Bachelor's degree in a STEM discipline: Statistics, Mathematics, Computer Science, etc.
Minimum of 2-4 years of experience building production-grade Generative AI applications.
Strong experience building GenAI workflows (e.g., agents, RAG, fine-tuning, orchestration).
Advanced proficiency in Python and experience with frameworks like LangChain or LlamaIndex.
Deep understanding of transformer models, tokenization, embeddings, and context windows.
Experience with cloud infrastructure (preferably GCP) and managing vector databases at scale.
Demonstrated ability to design and deploy autonomous or semi-autonomous agent workflows.

Preferred Skills:

Master's/PhD degree in a STEM discipline: Statistics, Mathematics, Computer Science, etc
Experience deploying LLM-powered agents in enterprise or critical applications.
Familiarity with AI practices (bias mitigation, prompt safety, hallucination detection).
